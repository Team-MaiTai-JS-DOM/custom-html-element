when new shape is created it is added to the codding div, and if i enable overflow:hiden,
the newly created shape is invisible. TODO: make it to be added to some other div with nearer z-index on creation time

the code for deleting an element or group of, should be finished

the logic changing the colors of the docks when near to an available dock is not polished yet. still looks aceptably good

i decided user to be not able to insert elements in the very middle of a chain, because what if user decides to insert a
forever block in the middle of the group. because forever has no tail, the rest of chain would hang somewhere uncertainly

center horizontaly the titles of the shapes
